Supervised Machine Learning  Case Study  
Iris Dataset with Decision Tree Plotting 
• In this application we remove one entry from each label of iris dataset and train with
the remaining entries.
• And we apply predictions based on Decision tree with that removed entries.
• We plot the decision tree using pydot library.
Consider below characteristics of Machine Learning Application :
Classifier : Decision Tree
DataSet : Iris Dataset
Features : Sepal Width, Sepal Length, Petal Width, Petal Length
Labels : Versicolor, Setosa , Virginica
Training Dataset : 147 Entries
Testing Dataset : 3 Entries
